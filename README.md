# 🚗 Vehicle Counter System using OpenCV

This project implements a **real-time vehicle counting system** using Python and OpenCV. It detects vehicles in a video stream and counts them as they cross a defined virtual line. The system uses background subtraction and contour detection to identify moving vehicles in a frame.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create a Python-based computer vision application that:
- Detects moving vehicles in a video feed.
- Counts vehicles as they cross a predefined line.
- Displays real-time count and detection visuals.

---

## 🧠 Motive

Vehicle counting systems have numerous real-world applications:
- Traffic monitoring
- Toll booth automation
- Smart city analytics
- Parking lot management

This project is a **learning-level implementation** designed to demonstrate motion detection, object tracking, and video processing using OpenCV.

---

## 📹 How It Works

- Reads frames from a video or webcam feed.
- Applies background subtraction to identify moving objects.
- Filters and detects vehicles using contours.
- Tracks their center points to count when they cross a horizontal line.
- Uses an offset to avoid double-counting.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Numpy

---

## 🧾 Features

- Real-time vehicle detection and counting
- Configurable detection zone
- Motion detection using background subtraction (MOG)
- Frame-by-frame object tracking
- Line-based crossing logic with offset margin

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-counter-system.git
cd vehicle-counter-system
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Place your video file (e.g., `tvid.mp4`) in the root directory.

4. Run the script:

```bash
python vehicle.py
```

> Press **Enter** to stop the video feed.

---

## 📸 Sample Output

You will see rectangles drawn around vehicles and a counter updated each time a vehicle crosses the line.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Integrate YOLO or other object detection models for vehicle classification.
* Export data to CSV or database for reporting.
* Add timestamped logs of vehicle entries.
* Deploy using a Raspberry Pi with camera module.
